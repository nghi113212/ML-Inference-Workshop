## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you're a data scientist at an e-commerce company. Your team has built a **fraud detection model** that needs to analyze every transaction in real-time. The business requirements are demanding:

- **Performance**: Detect fraud within **50ms** to prevent transaction delays
- **Scale**: Handle **Black Friday traffic spikes** from 100 to 10,000 requests per second
- **Cost**: Keep infrastructure costs under control during low-traffic periods
- **Reliability**: **99.9% uptime** requirement for production systems

Your current server-based deployment can't meet these demands cost-effectively.

## The Challenge

Deploying machine learning models to production is complex and expensive. Traditional approaches struggle with:

- **High latency** - Business applications need sub-100ms response times
- **Unpredictable scaling** - Traffic spikes are hard to handle efficiently  
- **Infrastructure costs** - Over-provisioned servers waste money
- **Operational overhead** - Managing servers, scaling, and monitoring

## Our Solution: Serverless ML Architecture

AWS serverless architecture solves these problems by providing:

- **Pay-per-request pricing** - No idle costs
- **Automatic scaling** - From zero to thousands of requests
- **Sub-100ms latency** - With provisioned concurrency
- **Built-in monitoring** - CloudWatch and X-Ray integration
- **Enterprise security** - IAM and VPC support

### Solution Architecture

**How it works:**
1. **API Gateway** receives and validates requests
2. **Lambda** loads model and processes inference (with caching check)
3. **ElastiCache** stores frequent predictions for instant retrieval
4. **CloudWatch** monitors performance and logs all activities

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this workshop, you will:

- Know how to build a machine learning model
- Deploy scalable ML models on AWS serverless infrastructure
- Implement effective caching strategies for ML workloads
- Set up production monitoring and alerting
- Achieve consistent sub-100ms response times
