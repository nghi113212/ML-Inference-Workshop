# Real-time Machine Learning Inference with AWS Lambda & API Gateway

## Workshop Overview

This workshop provides hands-on experience in building and deploying a production-ready machine learning inference system using AWS serverless technologies. You'll learn to create a scalable ML API that delivers predictions with sub-100ms latency while maintaining cost efficiency and enterprise-level security.

---

## What You'll Build

A complete serverless ML inference solution featuring:

- **Ultra-fast API responses** (< 100ms) using AWS Lambda and API Gateway
- **Intelligent caching** with ElastiCache Valkey for optimal performance  
- **Production monitoring** using CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray
- **Enterprise security** with IAM roles and VPC integration
- **Auto-scaling capabilities** that handle traffic spikes seamlessly


## Key Technologies

- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless compute for ML model hosting
- **API Gateway** - RESTful API management and routing
- **ElastiCache Valkey** - High-performance caching layer
- **Python 3.12** - Runtime environment with Scikit-learn
- **CloudWatch & X-Ray** - Comprehensive monitoring and tracing


## Learning Goals

By completing this workshop, you will:

- Know how to build a machine learning model
- Deploy production-ready ML models on AWS serverless infrastructure
