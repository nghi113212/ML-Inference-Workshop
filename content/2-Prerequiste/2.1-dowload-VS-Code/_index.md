## Overview

**Choose an IDE that supports plug-ins for various languages** to make development more convenient, such as **Visual Studio Code, Atom, Notepad++, etc.**

**Plug-ins by IDE:** Naturally, you will need **plug-ins for Markdown** (such as _Markdown All in One_, _Markdown TOC_, etc.). When working with any language, **VS Code will usually suggest the relevant plug-ins**, so there's no need to worry.
