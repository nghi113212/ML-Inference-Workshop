## Overview

**Docker Desktop** is essential for this ML Inference workshop because AWS Lambda supports **container-based deployments**. You'll use Docker to:

- **Package ML models** with their dependencies into containers
- **Test locally** before deploying to AWS Lambda
- **Build optimized images** for faster cold starts
- **Manage Python dependencies** and ML libraries efficiently
- **Ensure consistent environments** between development and production

### Why Containers for ML Inference?

- **Larger Package Sizes**: ML libraries like scikit-learn, numpy exceed Lambda's 250MB limit
- **Dependency Management**: Complex ML dependencies are easier to manage in containers
- **Performance Optimization**: Pre-built images reduce cold start times
- **Reproducible Deployments**: Same environment across dev, staging, and production
